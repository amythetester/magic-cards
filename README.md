## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js, CSS, and HTML
- Backend: Magic The Gathering API
- Infrastructure: AWS Amplify (S3 bucket)

## Project Dependencies

- [MTGSDK](https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-sdk-javascript) (Magic the Gathering SDK): used to call the MTG API
- [React Infinite Scroler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller): used to call API and render additional cards when user scrolls to bottom of the screen
- React Router: used to route 'pages'. This was added to the project so future work and more 'pages' could be added.
